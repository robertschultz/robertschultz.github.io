I have been putting a lot of energy into Docker which is a new platform to package, configure and ship your applications through containers. If you haven’t read up on it I suggest you do.

Over the weekend I put together a small Dockerfile on my GitHub to configure and build a Docker image for your own containers. I will continue to evolve it but please feel free to giv it a try, fork it and contribute back. I’m open to suggestions.

I will continue to add future Docker configurations to GitHub.
