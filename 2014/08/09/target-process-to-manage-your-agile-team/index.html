	<section class="post-content">
		<p>When we build teams to focus on delivering high quality and efficient products, one of the initial tasks to focus on is selecting the right process for the team. You typically can do this in two ways: be extremely simple and use something like a whiteboard and post-it’s, or pick a tool that can solve the problem for you.</p>

<p>I tend to rely on the latter.</p>

<p>I have spent countless hours searching and scouring the web to try to find the best tool that gives me all of the features I need. Beautiful and intuitive interface. Flexible configuration for your process. Cost effective. Effective reports. 3rd party integration.</p>

<p>When I was spinning up my last team I evaluated many and did end up using Sprint.ly first. Really great interface, developed by who has respect in the community. But it just did not “flow” the way I wanted. That’s okay though, they are a new product and will eventually become a strong player.</p>

<p>Previously I did a trial of Target Process but it was verison 2.0 which has a really outdated and clunky design.</p>

<p>Then I came across Target Process 3.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tp1.png" width="700" title="" /></p>

<p>This new design is absolutely bad ass. It basically sits on top of their existing code base with a fresh new look and feel. They support flexible process configurations with their boards. Do you use Scrum? No problem. Kanban? No problem. Want Scrumban? It’s that simple.</p>

<p>We started using this in our team and we were able to reduce the time in our Backlog Grooming meetings quite significantly through using a special board just built for this need. You can see below the overall view of your Kanban board which mimics your physical board you may have currently on your teams wall.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tp2.jpeg" width="700" title="" /></p>

<p>Oh yeah, they have an iOS mobile version of Target Process 3 as well. Right now they support up to 5 users for free. That’s perfect for a small dev team to get started on.</p>

<p>As far as their roadmap goes, it looks like they are aggresively working on some additional features such as roadmaps, list based view of your work items, visual encoding such as custom colors and options for your work items.</p>

<p>I’m pretty excited to see where this company goes. They are becoming a serious competitor in the agile project management space and one to watch out for.</p>
